# Elden Ring Map Project

## About

While discovering the world of Elden Ring, I like to keep notes, scribble on maps, etc.

Most of the maps I've found online have details that I would like to discover for myself, and the majority have markers that could potentially spoil the game.

Eventually I would like this project to provide outlines of the world map that can be used to annotate.

For now it's just a [collection of high-resolution slices of the map](9Parts) that can be used in digital applications (e.g., OneNote) to keep notes.

This project uses maps from jamut69's [Elden Ring Map - Upscaled and Optimized](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/237) mod.
